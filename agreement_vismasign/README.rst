===================
Agreement vismasign
===================
This module integrates the OCA ``agreement`` module with Visma Sign electronic
signatures.

The module allows sending agreements directly to Visma Sign, tracking
signature status automatically, and downloading signed PDF documents.

Features
========
* Create an agreement directly from a quotation (``agreement_sale``), either
  manually with a button or automatically on order confirmation
* Select the document template per agreement type, so lease agreements and
  the different sale agreement templates each use their own report
* Send agreements to Visma Sign directly from the agreement form
* Attach a local copy of the rendered (unsigned) document for audit purposes
* Store Visma Sign document, file, and invitation UUIDs on the agreement
* Automatic signature status synchronization using a scheduled action
* Download and attach the signed PDF document automatically
* Multi-company support

Configuration
=============

#. Go to
   *Agreements -> Settings* and configure:

   * **Auto-create Agreement on Order Confirmation**
     If enabled, confirming a quotation that has an agreement type set
     automatically creates the linked agreement. Otherwise, use the
     *Create Agreement* button on the quotation.

#. On each *Agreement Type* (*Agreements -> Configuration -> Agreement
   Types*), set the **Visma Sign Report XML-ID**: the technical XML-ID of
   the report action used to render the document for agreements of that
   type, for example ``sale.action_report_saleorder`` or a report provided
   by ``agreement_legal``. This is required before an agreement of that
   type can be sent for signature.

#. Ensure that a Visma Sign backend is configured for the company (requires
   the **Connector Manager** group (``connector.group_connector_manager``) —
   see ``connector_vismasign``'s README). Sending an agreement itself does
   not require this group, since ``action_vismasign_send()`` accesses the
   backend via ``sudo()``.

Usage
=====

#. On a quotation, set the **Agreement Type**, then either:

   * click *Create Agreement*, or
   * confirm the order, if automatic creation is enabled

   This creates an agreement linked to the quotation via ``agreement_id``.

#. Open the agreement (not a template).

#. Click:

   ::

       Send for Signature

#. The module will:

   * render the document using the report configured on the agreement's type
   * attach the rendered PDF to the agreement as an audit-trail copy
   * create a Visma Sign document
   * upload the PDF
   * send the signature invitation to the partner

#. Signature status is updated automatically every 15 minutes using a cron job.

#. Once the agreement has been signed:

   * the signed PDF is downloaded automatically
   * the signed document is attached to the agreement
   * a chatter notification is posted on the agreement

Technical Details
=================

Scheduled Action
----------------

The module installs the following scheduled action:

::

    Visma Sign: Update Invitation Status (Agreements)

Default interval:

* Every 15 minutes

Agreement Fields
-----------------

The following technical fields are added to the agreement:

* ``vismasign_document_uuid``
* ``vismasign_file_uuid``
* ``vismasign_invitation_uuid``
* ``vismasign_status``
* ``vismasign_last_check``

Agreement Type Fields
----------------------

* ``report_xmlid``: technical XML-ID of the report action used to render
  agreements of this type. Required before an agreement of that type can
  be sent for signature.

Sale Order
----------

* ``action_create_agreement()``: creates the agreement for the quotation
  using its ``agreement_type_id`` (from ``agreement_sale``) and links it back
  via ``agreement_id``.
* Confirming an order auto-creates the agreement when the
  ``agreement_vismasign.auto_create_agreement_on_confirm`` system parameter
  is enabled.
